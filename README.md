# raritysniper-webscraper 
NFT_collector.ipynb is the jupyter notebook used to webscrape nfts off rarity sniper. Apart from the main code, this repo has 3 sample files: nftcollections_copy,
cards_copy, and collection_socials_copy. Each of these files are CSV. And represent the output of the program as it was run on 21st of December. Rarity sniper switches up
its nft collection page quite often, hence when you run the program on your system, you may receive a different output altogether.
