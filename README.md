# raritysniper-webscraper 
NFT collector.ipynb is a jupyter notebook used to webscrape nfts off rarity sniper. Apart from the main code, three sample files: nftcollections_copy,
cards_copy, and collection_socials_copy are of relevance to the project and can be viewed on the link: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1WVkG34RFODL-Y9qhUnnujuc1iPZQmku9 . Each of these files are in CSV format, And represent the output of the program as it was run on 21st of December. Rarity sniper switches up its nft collection page quite often, hence when you run the program on your system, you may receive a different output altogether.
